## Deprecated

This module was an experimental fork and is now obsolete and will not be maintained.
Any projects using `terraform-terraform-label` are encouraged to switch to using
[terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label),
which is actively maintained and used by all current Cloud Posse Terraform modules.

This module was a fork of [terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label), made
at a time when that project was using the Terraform `null` provider (hence the "null" in the name), in order
to remove the `null` provider dependency. This was accomplished by removing outputs that required the `null`
provider.

With the features that became available in Terraform 0.12, the `terraform-null-label` project was able
to retain all of its features and also
[remove the `null` provider](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/commit/d6d24b80d687e76e029f39f444d0163b42c5d5e0),
removing any incentive to further develop `terraform-terraform-label`.

With the key distinguishing feature of `terraform-terraform-label` no longer being a distinguishing feature,
this module was no longer necessary, and all focus returned to maintaining and enhancing `terraform-null-label`,
which now far surpasses this module in functionality.

We literally have [*hundreds of other terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!


### Historical Description

Terraform module designed to generate consistent label names and tags for resources. Use `terraform-terraform-label` to implement a strict naming convention.


#### `terraform-terraform-label` is a fork of [terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label) which uses only the core Terraform provider.

A label follows the following convention: `{namespace}-{stage}-{name}-{attributes}`. The delimiter (e.g. `-`) is interchangeable.

It's recommended to use one `terraform-terraform-label` module for every unique resource of a given resource type.
For example, if you have 10 instances, there should be 10 different labels.
However, if you have multiple different kinds of resources (e.g. instances, security groups, file systems, and elastic IPs), then they can all share the same label assuming they are logically related.

All [Cloud Posse modules](https://github.com/cloudposse?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=terraform-&type=&language=) use
the related [terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label) module to ensure resources can be instantiated multiple times within an account and without conflict.

**NOTE:** The second `terraform` word in `terraform-terraform-label` refers to the primary Terraform provider used in this module.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


### Simple Example

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "eg_prod_bastion_label" {
  source = "cloudposse/label/terraform"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "prod"
  name       = "bastion"
  attributes = ["public"]
  delimiter  = "-"

  tags = {
    "BusinessUnit" = "XYZ",
    "Snapshot"     = "true"
  }
}
```

This will create an `id` with the value of `eg-prod-bastion-public`.

Now reference the label when creating an instance (for example):

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "eg_prod_bastion_public" {
  instance_type = "t1.micro"
  tags          = module.eg_prod_bastion_label.tags
}
```

Or define a security group:

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "eg_prod_bastion_public" {
  vpc_id = var.vpc_id
  name   = module.eg_prod_bastion_label.id
  tags   = module.eg_prod_bastion_label.tags
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```


### Advanced Example

Here is a more complex example with two instances using two different labels. Note how efficiently the tags are defined for both the instance and the security group.

```hcl
module "eg_prod_bastion_abc_label" {
  source = "cloudposse/label/terraform"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "prod"
  name       = "bastion"
  attributes = ["abc"]
  delimiter  = "-"

  tags = {
    "BusinessUnit" = "ABC"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "eg_prod_bastion_abc" {
  name = module.eg_prod_bastion_abc_label.id
  tags = module.eg_prod_bastion_abc_label.tags
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "eg_prod_bastion_abc" {
  instance_type          = "t1.micro"
  tags                   = module.eg_prod_bastion_abc_label.tags
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.eg_prod_bastion_abc.id]
}

module "eg_prod_bastion_xyz_label" {
  source = "cloudposse/label/terraform"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace  = "eg"
  stage      = "prod"
  name       = "bastion"
  attributes = ["xyz"]
  delimiter  = "-"

  tags = {
    "BusinessUnit" = "XYZ"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "eg_prod_bastion_xyz" {
  name = module.eg_prod_bastion_xyz_label.id
  tags = module.eg_prod_bastion_xyz_label.tags
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "eg_prod_bastion_xyz" {
  instance_type          = "t1.micro"
  tags                   = module.eg_prod_bastion_xyz_label.tags
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.eg_prod_bastion_xyz.id]
}
```
